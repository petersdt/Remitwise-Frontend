## Backend / API

### Overview

This Next.js application uses API routes to handle backend functionality. API routes are located in the `app/api/` directory and follow Next.js 14 App Router conventions.

**Key API Routes:**
- `/api/auth/*` - Authentication endpoints (wallet connect, nonce generation, signature verification)
- `/api/transactions/*` - Transaction history and status
- `/api/contracts/*` - Soroban smart contract interactions
- `/api/health` - Health check endpoint

All API routes are serverless functions deployed alongside the frontend.

## Design Notes

- All forms are currently disabled (placeholders)
- UI uses a blue/indigo color scheme
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Components are structured for easy integration

## Future Enhancements

- Real-time transaction updates
- Push notifications for bill reminders
- Charts and graphs for financial insights
- Multi-language support
- Dark mode
- Mobile app (React Native)
